In an attempt to rally the people behind the state, there has been an increase in pan-nationalist propaganda with clear support from the government.\n\nAs a side-effect, proponents of South America unification have already begun citing historical parallels, and point out how the current state of affairs can be seen as simply a natural continuation of earlier attempts at unifying the region. The [From.GetOldAdjective] government has eagerly jumped on the bandwagon of this line of thinking, and has now officially proclaimed a 'restoration of the United Provinces', renaming the country to '[From.GetNameDef]'."
